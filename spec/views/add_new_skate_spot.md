# Add a new skate spot
**Route:** `/add`

## User perspective
- As a user, I want to be able to quickly add a new spot to the map with the least amount of interactions so that I can contribute to the skate community!

### Photos
- As a user, I want to be able to:
    - upload photos from within my device
    - take photos of a spot directly in the app
    - see a preview of photos before submitting a spot
    - delete unwanted photos before submitting
    - rearrange the photos before submitting (order)


### Location
- As a user, I want to be able to:
    - choose a spot location on the map with a pin
    - type in an address to provide the location
    - use my current location as the spot location
    
### Name
- As a user, I want to be able to type in the name of a spot.

### Additional data (later used for filtering)
  - As a user, I want to be able to describe the attributes of a spot.

    List of attributes:
      - obstacles (mini ramp, quarter pipe etc.)
      - lighting (yes/no)
      - type (skatepark, public institution, parking etc.)
