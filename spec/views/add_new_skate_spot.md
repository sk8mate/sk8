# Add a new skate spot
**Route:** `/add`

## User perspective
As a user, I want to be able to quickly add a new spot to the map with the least amount of interactions so that I can contribute to the skate community!

### Photos of a spot
As a user, I want to be able to:
    - upload photos from within my device
    - take photos of a spot directly in the app
    - see a preview of photos before submitting a spot
    - delete unwanted photos before submitting
    - rearrange the photos before submitting (order)


### Location of a spot
    As a user, I want to be able to:
        - choose a spot location on the map with a pin
        - type in an address to provide the location
        - use my current location as the spot location
    
### Spot's name**
    As a user, I want to be able to type in the name of a spot.

### Additional spot's data (later used for filtering)
    As a user, I want to be able to describe the attributes of a spot.

    List of attributes:
        - obstacles (mini ramp, quarter pipe etc.)
        - lighting (yes/no)
        - type (skatepark, public institution, parking etc.)
